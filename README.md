# Contextual Cards Flutter

This Flutter project is a plug-and-play container that renders a list of contextual cards dynamically fetched from an API. The container can be added to any screen/widget and functions independently, as per the requirements.

## Features

- Fetches contextual cards from an API and renders them in a list.
- Handles various types of cards, including dynamic images, gradients, buttons, and links.
- Supports deeplink handling for cards, buttons, and formatted text entities.
- Swipe-down-to-refresh functionality.
- Handles loading, error states, and customizable actions (e.g., "remind later", "dismiss now").
- Supports different design types for contextual cards based on the API response.
- Handles swipe actions and dynamic visibility of cards (on "remind later" or "dismiss now" actions).
- Reusable and flexible components, easy to integrate into any screen/widget.

## API Reference

- The API response will provide a list of **Card Groups** containing various **Cards**. The properties of each card (e.g., title, description, images, CTAs, etc.) will be dynamically rendered.
